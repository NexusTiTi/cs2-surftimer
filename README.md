## Admin Commands

```
wst_mm_delete_top_records <mapname> <number_of_records> - Removes the top N records for a map (incase of glitched times), requires map reload to show in game
wst_mm_update scripts - Updates Lua scripts
wst_mm_update zones - Updates zones from github
```

## Installation

First will first need to [install Metamod](https://cs2.poggu.me/metamod/installation/). 

Then install [Will's SurfTimer Metamod Plugin](https://github.com/ws-cs2/cs2-surftimer/releases/) and [CS2Fixes](https://github.com/Source2ZE/CS2Fixes/releases/)

The first time you run the server run the following commands in your server console
```
wst_mm_update scripts
wst_mm_update zones
```

These commands will automatically download the latest Vscript's and zones for the timer. As the timer is being updated everyday I would recommend updating the scripts regularily.

In the 'cfg' folder if you are running on listen server create (or add to) 'listenserver.cfg'. 
If you are running a dedicated server then create (or add to) 'server.cfg'.
```
sv_cheats 1
script_reload_code wst
sv_cheats 0
```

## Saving & Loading Times

The Lua VScript API is a sandbox and provides no way (that I know of) to save data to disk, call web API's or use databases.

Therefore we have made a Metamod plugin which handles saving times to disk.

Map times are saved in `scripts/wst_records/<map_name>.txt`

File format:
```
"Leaderboard"
{
    "version" "_1.4"
    "Main"
    {
        "STEAM_0:1:123456"
        {
            "name" "Player One"
            "time" "60.00"
        }
        "STEAM_0:0:654321"
        {
            "name" "Player Two"
            "time" "120.00"
        }
    }
    "Bonus"
    {
        "STEAM_0:1:123456"
        {
            "name" "Player One"
            "time" "10.00"
        }
        "STEAM_0:0:654321"
        {
            "name" "Player Two"
            "time" "20.00"
        }
    }
}
```

## Zones

Zone files go in `scripts/wst_zones/<mapname>.txt`

v1 & v2 are the position in world space of two opposite corners of a box. Come discuss in discord if you are zoning maps so we can add the zones back into this repo.

surf_beginner example:
```
"Zones"
{
    "version" "_1.0"
    "data"
    {
        "start"
        {
            "v1" "-448.150726, -47.964149, 320"
            "v2" "191.463989, 257.725311, 500"
        }
        "end"
        {
            "v1" "-4544.320312, 4868.677734, 3096"
            "v2" "-6078.667480, 5248.378418, 3296"
        }
    }
}
```

## Update to 1.4

Records file need to be modified
Version now needs to be "_1.4" and "data" converted to "Main"
This should be done automatically by lua when detecting version "_1.0"

OLD (< 1.4)
```
"mg_nxr_course_v2"
{
	"version"		"_1.0"
	"data"
	{
		"[U:1:59294850]"
		{
			"time"		"42.343750"
			"name"		"TiTi"
		}
	}
}
```

NEW (1.4)
```
"mg_nxr_course_v2"
{
	"version"		"_1.4"
	"Main"
	{
		"[U:1:59294850]"
		{
			"time"		"42.343750"
			"name"		"TiTi"
		}
	}
}
```

## Future of this plugin

The goal for this project is just to make something that works for the short term - VScript is depreciated and will probably stop working at some point!
